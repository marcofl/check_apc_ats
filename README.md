#Check APC ATS

This is a basic icinga plugin to monitor the status of Schneider Electric / APC Automatic Transfer Switches
written in ruby (works with ruby 1.8.7 and snmp-gem 1.2 or later)

###Installation
snmp gem has to be installed
```
gem install snmp
```
### Usage

```
./check_apc_ats -H 1.2.3.4 -C public
Check ATS: State OK
```
as an icinga 1.x check command:
```
define command{
        command_name    check_apc_ats
        command_line    $USER1$/check_apc_ats -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -C $ARG1$
        }
```
for old ruby 1.8.x (like on CentOS 6) use this command, so gems require works:
```
        command_line /usr/bin/ruby -rubygems $USER1$/check_apc_ats -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -C $ARG1$
```
as an icinga 2.x check command:
```
		object CheckCommand "check_apc_ats" {
			import "plugin-check-command"

		command = [ PluginDir + "/check_apc_ats" ]

		arguments = {
		"-H" = "$address$"
		"-C" = "public"
			}
		}
```
